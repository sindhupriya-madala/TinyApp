# TinyApp
As an avid twitter poster, I want to be able to shorten links so that I can fit more non-link text in my tweets.
The Tiny URL generated using this app is a random string of length 6.

  command to run server is `node express_server.js`
  
  * When I visit http://localhost:8080/ it redirects me to registration page.
  
  ![registeration](https://github.com/sindhupriya-madala/TinyApp/blob/master/views/images/register.jpg)
  
  * After Registration it opens the url's index page.
